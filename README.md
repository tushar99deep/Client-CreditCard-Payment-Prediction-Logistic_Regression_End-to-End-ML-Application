# Client-CreditCard-Payment-Prediction-Logistic_Regression_End-to-End-ML-Application
This is an END-TO-END-MACHINE-LEARNING-WEB APPLICATION. This application can be used to predict whether the client is going to pay their due next month or not. 
For building the model I have used Logistic Regression ML Algorithm and for web application I have used FLASK library.
