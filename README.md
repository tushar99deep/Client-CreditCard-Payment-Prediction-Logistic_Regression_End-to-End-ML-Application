# Client-CreditCard-Payment-Prediction-Logistic_Regression_End-to-End-ML-Application
## Project Overview
Client Credit Card Payment Prediction is an end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts whether a client is likely to pay their credit card due next month or not. It utilizes a logistic regression model to make predictions based on various features. The application includes a complete pipeline for data preprocessing, model training, and prediction. The project is developed using Python.
## Project Structure
The application consists of the following components:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: This module handles data cleaning, feature engineering, and feature scaling. It ensures that the data is in the appropriate format and ready for model training.

2. **Model Training**: The model training component applies logistic regression to the preprocessed data. It conducts feature selection, model training, and evaluation using appropriate metrics such as accuracy and AUC-ROC.

3. **Prediction**: The prediction module utilizes the trained logistic regression model to make predictions on new data. It applies the same preprocessing steps as the data preprocessing module to ensure consistent results.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [XYZ Credit Card Dataset](link-to-dataset). It contains information on various factors such as credit limit, payment history, and demographic attributes, which are used to predict the likelihood of credit card payment.

## Model Architecture
The logistic regression algorithm is employed to predict the probability of credit card payment. Feature engineering techniques are applied to handle categorical variables, and feature scaling is performed to normalize numerical attributes. The model achieved [X]% accuracy on the test set, with an AUC-ROC score of [Y].

## Code Examples
```python
# Example code snippet demonstrating data preprocessing
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Perform data preprocessing
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
data['education'] = label_encoder.fit_transform(data['education'])

# Continue with other preprocessing steps
...
```

## Results and Conclusion
The logistic regression model achieved [X]% accuracy on the test set, showcasing its effectiveness in predicting client credit card payment. The application provides valuable insights to financial institutions for risk assessment and decision-making.

The Dockerization of the application ensures easy deployment and scalability, making it suitable for integration into larger systems or as a standalone service.
